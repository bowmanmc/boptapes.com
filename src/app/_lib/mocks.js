    Did you know that the B-52s were John Lennon's favorite band?
</p>
<p>
    They formed as "the B-52's" in 1976 when Cindy Wilson, Ricky Wilson (her elder brother), Pierson, 
    Strickland, and cowbell player, poet, and lead vocalist Schneider held an impromptu jam session 
    after sharing a flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Georgia. When they first 
    jammed, Strickland played guitar and Ricky Wilson played congas. They later played their first 
    concert (with Wilson on guitar) in 1977 at a Valentine's Day party for their friends.

    The name "B-52's" comes from a particular beehive hairdo resembling the nose cone of the aircraft, 
    which Pierson and Cindy Wilson wore in performances during the band's first decade. Other names 
    the band considered were the Tina-Trons and Fellini's Children. Strickland suggested the name 
    after a dream he had of a band performing in a hotel lounge. In the dream, he heard someone whisper 
    in his ear that the band's name was "the B-52's".
